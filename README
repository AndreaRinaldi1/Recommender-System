--------PROJECT STRUCTURE-------------
data: contains the dataset and validation set, which are a split of the orginal given ratings. Also contains a sample submission. 
src: code of the project and the individual models
report: contains the report.pdf final version of the report
papers: contains the papers pdf used for our project


---------RUNNING THE CODE----------------
First, you need to run every individual model. These will create a .npy file which is a complete user-item matrix with predictions for every entry
Secondly, put all these .npy in a single folder called TODO:NAME AND PLACE OF FOLDER. 
Thirdly, run the Ensemble.py, which will create a .csv file "EnsembleSubmission.csv". This is the file to upload to Kaggle. 

The models to be run are: 
-bayesianPMF.py
-KMeans.py
-NPCA.py
-RidgeSVD.py
-RSVD.py
-RunAutoEncoder.py
-Similarities.py


---------IMPORTANT NOTES----------------
-If you don't want to run all of these models individually, you can ask us to provide you with the completed .npy files from the individual models. They are stored on another repository for place issue.
-IOUtils.py is only used to provide IO functionalities regarding the submission.
-CV.py is only used to split the dataset into a validation set and train set.
-AutoEncoder.py is the model in tensorflow for the autoencoder. It is used by the RunAutoEncoder.py script.
